# Stoffle, a toy programming language

Stoffle is a toy programming language developed as a series of posts for the [Honeybadger blog](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/) by [Alex Braha Stoll](http://alexbs.com.br/).

It is currently a work in progress. Here is its current state:

- Lexer (done)
- Parser (done)
- Interpreter (wip)

When studying Stoffle's current implementation, please have in mind that even parts that are mostly done can change as we get closer to finishing the implementation as a whole and new ideas emerge.

## Published blog posts

If you are interested in this project, I highly recommend you read the blog posts before diving into the implementation:

- [Building a Toy Lexer in Ruby](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/building-lexer-ruby/)

## Where does the name Stoffle come from?

Stoffle is the name of a mischievous honey badger from South Africa. Watch a [short BBC clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36UNSoJenI) about Stoffle on YouTube.
