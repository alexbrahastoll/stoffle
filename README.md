# Stoffle, a toy programming language

Stoffle is a toy programming language developed as a series of posts for the [Honeybadger blog](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/) by [Alex Braha Stoll](http://alexbs.com.br/).

The language implementation itself is done, but there are still some posts pending publication.

- Lexer (done)
- Parser (done)
- Interpreter (done)

## Published blog posts

If you are interested in this project, I highly recommend you read the blog posts before diving into the implementation:

## Where does the name Stoffle come from?

Stoffle is the name of a mischievous honey badger from South Africa. Watch a [short BBC clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36UNSoJenI) about Stoffle on YouTube.
